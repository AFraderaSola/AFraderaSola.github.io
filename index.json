Thus what I want to do is to connect the usual entries on a CV (education, positions, publications…) by year, so I can visualize, in an intuitive way, how a career path has developed.\nThus our goal is to create an interactive network of the CV. If you would like to know how to generate something similar, continue to read.\nIntroduction The inspiration for this network-plot is the fantastic package and tutorial datadrivencv, by Nick Strayer, which has the goal of automatizing the CV update. To do so, you would keep each entry on the CV on a .csv file that you would later render into a a .pdf or .html file. In such file, rows correspond to each entry on your CV, for instance your education degrees or job experiences, and columns describe the positions, for instance start year or location.\nThe data The network-plot starting point is, this way, a CV entries data file. You can check out an example of a CV entries file at Nick’s Strayer tutorial spreadsheet. You can also download the necessary data to replicate this tutorial here.\nFor the network plot I just need each entry on the CV and its corresponding year, so I start by filtering our data with dplyr:\n#Load entries data file: my_df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;network_entries.csv\u0026#34;) #Filter relevant columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) I want to make sure that all entries in start and end are numeric, as they should be years:\nmy_relevant_df$start \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$start) my_relevant_df$end \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$end) All non numeric entries (like empty values or years set to “current”) will be transformed into NA values. I will use this in our favour to further filter the data.\nFirst I want to kick out all the rows containing NA both in start and end, as those are time independent entries (like skills) not relevant to network-plot:\n#Flag NA values with the logic statement TRUE and combine columns start and year: my_relevant_df$filter \u0026lt;- interaction(is.na(my_relevant_df$start),is.na(my_relevant_df$end)) #Filter out all entries that are \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34; (NA values in both columns) and remove the filter columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df[!my_relevant_df$filter == \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34;,] my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) Our last step on data cleaning is assign year values to the remaining NA:\nNA values at the start column are assigned to be the same value that end year (i. e., a publication) NA values at the end column are assigned to current year (i. e., current job) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(start = ifelse(is.na(start), end, start)) current_year \u0026lt;- lubridate::year(lubridate::ymd(Sys.Date())) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(end = ifelse(is.na(end), current_year, end)) Now that the data is cleaned up, I will generate the two data frames I need for the network plot:\nNodes data, containing each entry on the CV Edges data, containing the (year) connections among the CV entries I start by generating the edges. First step is to assign a numeric id to each entry and selecting the year columns:\nedges \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, start, end) Then I generate the edges with a function borrowed from the datadrivencv package:\n#Combine the start and end years into a integer range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(id, start, end) { dplyr::tibble(year = start:end, id = id) }) #Nest all entries per year range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(year) %\u0026gt;% tidyr::nest() %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rename(ids_for_year = data) #Generate the edges combination_indices \u0026lt;- function(n) { rep_counts \u0026lt;- (n:1) - 1 dplyr::tibble(a = rep(1:n, times = rep_counts), b = purrr::flatten_int(purrr::map(rep_counts, ~{ tail(1:n, .x) }))) } edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(year, ids_for_year) { combination_indices(nrow(ids_for_year)) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::transmute(year = year, from = ids_for_year$id[a], to = ids_for_year$id[b]) }) Then I proceed to generate the nodes data frame assigning, like in the edges data frame, a numeric id. Next we select the entries on the CV (titles) and the sections they belong to, which I clean up with the stringr package:\nnodes \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, title, section) # Make the sections look nices nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(section = stringr::str_to_title(stringr::str_replace_all(section, \u0026#34;_\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;))) The plot Now that I have generated the edges and nodes data frames, I can proceed with the first basic network.

Mass-spectrometry data was used to collect interaction partners for 40 RBPs with known functionalities in mRNA life cycle. Then, a network was constructed to connect all the proteins, and a guilt-by-association principle was applied to assign novel functionalities. As a result, a Shiny app database https://butterlab.imb-mainz.de/RINE/ was created for interactive data exploration. If you find the app interesting and want to learn more about the data analysis behind it, please continue reading.\nIntroduction This project is the foundation of my PhD thesis, which focuses on mass-spectrometry (MS) data, specifically on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their associated functionalities. In recent years, the number of proteins classified as RBPs has skyrocketed, with 1,273 proteins classified as RBPs in yeast alone. If you’re curious about this phenomenon, you can check out this informative review by Hentze et al. Despite the increasing number of proteins classified as RBPs, their functional roles remain largely unexplored.\nThe main reason behind this lack of functional details is that newly described RBPs mostly come from high-throughput techniques such as RNA interactome capture (RIC). These techniques generate large datasets and excel at identifying and classifying individuals, but they lack deep biological characterization. The goal of this project was to add a first layer of functional characterization while maintaining a high-throughput approach. Therefore, we selected 40 well-characterized yeast RBPs and identified their interaction partners with immunoprecipitation coupled to MS-based quantitative proteomics. With this data, we were able to build function-based networks to gather hints on which individuals might be involved in particular RNA-related pathways.\nThe Data Candidate RBPs To begin with, I aimed to gather the interaction partners of 40 chosen RBPs, which would serve as the foundation of our function-based networks. Before delving into the interactors data, let’s take a step back and examine the candidates data. Why specifically these 40 RBPs? How do they facilitate the formation of function-based networks? Moreover, what precisely do I mean by “function-based networks”?\nFunction-based network concept Let’s start by refreshing some basic network terminology. In this post, I will refer to the selected RBPs as “network hubs”, their interaction partners as “nodes”, and the connections between them as “edges”. By using this terminology, each square representing a target RBP can be considered a hub, each circle representing an IP interactor can be considered a node, and the lines representing connections between them can be considered edges. Using these three elements, I created the RBP interactome network. When we later filter this larger network for a particular functionality, we obtain a “function-based network”. For example, if we only keep the blue hubs, we can create a blue function-based network.\nWith our network lingua franca established, let’s now focus on our 40 RBP candidates. These RBPs were selected based on their potential to become the hubs on the function-based networks. To ensure this, it was crucial to choose well-studied candidates that play central roles in their pathways. To identify such candidates, I consulted the KEGG and Reactome databases, which helped me identify RBPs involved in RNA biology pathways such as degradation or splicing. Additionally, our candidates needed to be included in the TAP-tagged commercial library so that I could capture them with an antibody.\nInteractors data Immunoprecipitation experimental design I performed immunoprecipitation on each of the selected RBPs and captured all their interacting partners in the presence or absence of RNA. This allowed me to obtain two distinct groups of interactors:\nProtein-Protein interactors (PPI): As a result of RNA digestion by RNase A, all the nodes in this group interact with our hubs in an RNA-independent manner. RNA-dependent interactors (RDI): This group consists of all the nodes that interact with our hubs in an RNA-dependent manner. Using a label-free quantification (LFQ) MS protocol, I quantified the interactors in both groups. These interactors, along with the hub candidates, served as the building blocks for constructing the function-based networks.\nData analysis I have not included any code on this post but, If you get curious and want to check it, you can find it available at the following github repository github repository. I will reference which subfolders belong to each analysis on their corresponding subsection.\nRBP interactors quantification The code for this analysis can be found in the following github repository subfolder.

I was motivated by the abundance of existing packages and resources for DEG analysis and wanted to investigate the differences between the most popular methods, compare their results, and determine the optimal approach for identifying DEGs. To achieve this, I utilized a novel dataset focused on drought resistance in the ryegrass species Lolium perenne to test the various DEG detection packages and optimize the methodology. Through this project, I was able to contribute to the important field of crop agriculture while improving the accuracy and efficiency of DEG analysis.\nRNAseq, DEGs and R pacakges for data analysis RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is a popular method for measuring gene expression levels in cells or tissues, and RNAseq data analysis involves various steps, including quality control, alignment, quantification of gene expression, differential gene expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. Differential gene expression analysis identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which are genes that show significant changes in expression levels between two or more conditions. DEG analysis can provide valuable insights into gene regulation, discover novel transcripts, and identify potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment. DEG analysis involves several steps, including read alignment, quality control, normalization, and statistical testing, and there are several software tools and packages available for each step.\nFor this project, the focus was on the normalization and statistical testing stages of DEG analysis, with read alignment and quality control being performed ubiquitously throughout the analysis. The selection of the appropriate tool depends on various factors, such as study design, sample size, distribution of expression data, and desired level of sensitivity and specificity.Three widely used packages, edgeR, DESeq2, and limma+voom, were selected along with a less conventional package, baySeq, for comparison:\nedgeR: edgeR (Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression in R) is a software package used for the identification of differentially expressed genes in RNAseq datasets. It uses a negative binomial model and empirical Bayes estimation to estimate the dispersion parameters and gene-wise dispersion estimates. This package can be used for single-factor or multi-factor experimental designs.\nDESeq2: DESeq2 is a R package that can be used to analyze differential gene expression in RNAseq experiments. It uses the negative binomial distribution to model count data and provides methods for estimating size factors and dispersion parameters. DESeq2 also provides methods for normalizing data, performing hypothesis testing, and visualizing results.\nlimma+voom: limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data) is an R package that can be used to analyze differential gene expression in RNAseq datasets. It uses linear models to analyze differential expression and provides a range of functions for data normalization and visualization. The voom (Variance modeling at the Observed Mean) function in limma can be used to transform count data into log2-counts per million (logCPM) values, which can then be used with limma for differential expression analysis.\nbaySeq: baySeq is a software package for analyzing RNAseq data using Bayesian methods. It can be used to identify differentially expressed genes, quantify expression levels, and estimate the probability of differential expression. baySeq models count data using a negative binomial distribution and provides a flexible framework for incorporating prior information about gene expression.\nJury vote function to determine DEGs I decided to design a jury vote function that could incorporate the results from the four previously described DEGs packages (edgeR, DESeq2, limma+voom, and baySeq) with the following criteria:\nFor each gene, I calculated the p-value of differential expression for each package, using the recommended or default settings for each one. I applied a multiple testing correction to the p-values, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg or Bonferroni correction, to control for false positive results. I identified the genes that have a significant p-value after multiple testing correction, using a chosen significance threshold (e.g., FDR \u0026lt; 0.05). I ranked the genes based on the significance of their p-value for each gene/package, from most significant to least significant. I assigned a weight to each gene based on its rank, such that DEG is assigned with a value of 1 or 0 otherwise. I calculated a weighted average score for each gene, using the assigned weights. This would result in a single, combined score for each gene.
