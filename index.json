Thus what I want to do is to connect the usual entries on a CV (education, positions, publications…) by year, so I can visualize, in an intuitive way, how a career path has developed.\nThus our goal is to create an interactive network of the CV. If you would like to know how to generate something similar, continue to read.\nIntroduction The inspiration for this network-plot is the fantastic package and tutorial datadrivencv, by Nick Strayer, which has the goal of automatizing the CV update. To do so, you would keep each entry on the CV on a .csv file that you would later render into a a .pdf or .html file. In such file, rows correspond to each entry on your CV, for instance your education degrees or job experiences, and columns describe the positions, for instance start year or location.\nThe data The network-plot starting point is, this way, a CV entries data file. You can check out an example of a CV entries file at Nick’s Strayer tutorial spreadsheet. You can also download the necessary data to replicate this tutorial here.\nFor the network plot I just need each entry on the CV and its corresponding year, so I start by filtering our data with dplyr:\n#Load entries data file: my_df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;network_entries.csv\u0026#34;) #Filter relevant columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) I want to make sure that all entries in start and end are numeric, as they should be years:\nmy_relevant_df$start \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$start) my_relevant_df$end \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$end) All non numeric entries (like empty values or years set to “current”) will be transformed into NA values. I will use this in our favour to further filter the data.\nFirst I want to kick out all the rows containing NA both in start and end, as those are time independent entries (like skills) not relevant to network-plot:\n#Flag NA values with the logic statement TRUE and combine columns start and year: my_relevant_df$filter \u0026lt;- interaction(is.na(my_relevant_df$start),is.na(my_relevant_df$end)) #Filter out all entries that are \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34; (NA values in both columns) and remove the filter columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df[!my_relevant_df$filter == \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34;,] my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) Our last step on data cleaning is assign year values to the remaining NA:\nNA values at the start column are assigned to be the same value that end year (i. e., a publication) NA values at the end column are assigned to current year (i. e., current job) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(start = ifelse(is.na(start), end, start)) current_year \u0026lt;- lubridate::year(lubridate::ymd(Sys.Date())) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(end = ifelse(is.na(end), current_year, end)) Now that the data is cleaned up, I will generate the two data frames I need for the network plot:\nNodes data, containing each entry on the CV Edges data, containing the (year) connections among the CV entries I start by generating the edges. First step is to assign a numeric id to each entry and selecting the year columns:\nedges \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, start, end) Then I generate the edges with a function borrowed from the datadrivencv package:\n#Combine the start and end years into a integer range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(id, start, end) { dplyr::tibble(year = start:end, id = id) }) #Nest all entries per year range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(year) %\u0026gt;% tidyr::nest() %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rename(ids_for_year = data) #Generate the edges combination_indices \u0026lt;- function(n) { rep_counts \u0026lt;- (n:1) - 1 dplyr::tibble(a = rep(1:n, times = rep_counts), b = purrr::flatten_int(purrr::map(rep_counts, ~{ tail(1:n, .x) }))) } edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(year, ids_for_year) { combination_indices(nrow(ids_for_year)) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::transmute(year = year, from = ids_for_year$id[a], to = ids_for_year$id[b]) }) Then I proceed to generate the nodes data frame assigning, like in the edges data frame, a numeric id. Next we select the entries on the CV (titles) and the sections they belong to, which I clean up with the stringr package:\nnodes \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, title, section) # Make the sections look nices nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(section = stringr::str_to_title(stringr::str_replace_all(section, \u0026#34;_\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;))) The plot Now that I have generated the edges and nodes data frames, I can proceed with the first basic network. I do so with the visNetwork package and igraph nicely algorithm:\nvisNetwork::visNetwork(nodes, edges)%\u0026gt;% visNetwork::visIgraphLayout(layout = \u0026#34;layout_nicely\u0026#34;)%\u0026gt;% visNetwork::visOptions(highlightNearest = …","date":1658534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658534400,"objectID":"39fad286292c7bc348d36afef898debf","permalink":"https://AFraderaSola.github.io/project/cvnetwork/","publishdate":"2022-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cvnetwork/","section":"project","summary":"Do you want to make your CV **shine**?
