I used mass-spectrometry data to collect interaction partners for 40 RBPs with known functionalities on the mRNA life cycle. Then I constructed a network to connect all the proteins and use a guilt-by-association principle to assign novel functionalities. This resulted in the creation of a Shiny app database https://butterlab.imb-mainz.de/RINE/ where data can be interactively explored. If you find the app interesting and you want to learn more about the data analysis behind it, continue to read.\nIntroduction This project is the backbone of my PhD thesis which revolves around mass-spectrometry (MS) data, with a particular focus on RNA binding-proteins (RBPs) and their associated functionalities. In recent years, the number of detected proteins classified as RBPs has been skyrocketing; in yeast, for instance, there are 1,273 proteins classified as RBPs. You can check this nice review from Hentze et al. if you are curious about this phenomenon. Even so, and despite more and more proteins being classified as RBPs, their functional roles remain largely unexplored. The main reason behind the lack of functional details is that newly described RBPs mostly come from high-throughput techniques such as RNA interactome capture (RIC). These techniques usually generate big data sets and shine at identifying and classifying individuals, but they do lack deep biological characterization. The goal behind this project was to add a first layer of functional characterization while keeping a high-throughput. Thus, we selected 40 well-characterised yeast RBPs and identified its interaction partners with immunoprecipitation coupled to MS-based quantitative proteomics. With this data we were able to build function-based networks to gather hints on which individuals might be involved on particular RNA-related pathways.\nThe Data Candidate RBPs I wanted to collect the interaction partners for 40 selected RBPs, which would constitute the building blocks of our function-based networks. Before focusing on the interactors data itself let’s first take a step back and look at the candidates data. Why these 40 RBPs in particular? How do they enable function-based networks? Hell, what do I even mean by “function-based networks’\u0026#39;?\nFunction-based network concept Let’s start by refreshing some basic network terminology. During this post, I am gonna describe the selected RBPs as network hubs, their interaction partners as nodes, and the connections between them as edges. This way, each square (Target RBP) is a hub, each circle (IP interactor) is a node, and the lines (connections) are edges. These three elements are what I eventually used to create the RBP interactome network. When we later take a subset of this larger network, filtering for a particular functionality, we get what we describe as function-based networks. For instance, if we would keep only the blue hubs, we would obtain a blue function-based network. Now that I have established the network lingua franca, we can focus on our 40 RBP candidates. I selected them with the idea that, ultimately, they would become the hubs on the function-based networks. Thus it became paramount to select well-studied candidates with central roles on their pathways. I relied on the KEGG and Reactome databases to query RBPs involved in RNA biology pathways such as degradation or splicing. Finally, our candidates needed to be included on the TAP tagged comercial library so I could capture them with antibodies.\nInteractors data Immunoprecipitation experimental design I immunoprecipitated each selected RBP and pulled down all their interactor partners, in the presence or absence of RNA. This allowed to obtain two very distinctive groups of interactors:\nProtein-Protein interactors (PPI): Due to the RNA digestion, by RNase A, all the nodes in this group interact with our hubs in an RNA independent manner. RNA-dependent interactors (RDI): This group contains all the nodes that interact with our hubs in an RNA dependent manner. For both groups, the interactors were measured and quantified with a label-free quantification (LFQ) MS protocol. Together with the hub candidates, the PPI and RDI nodes are the building blocks which I used to construct the function-based networks. Data analysis I have not included any code on this post but, If you get curious and want to check it, you can find it available at the following github repository github repository. I will reference which subfolders belong to each analysis on their corresponding subsection.\nRBP interactors quantification The code for this analysis can be found in the following github repository subfolder.

Thus what I want to do is to connect the usual entries on a CV (education, positions, publications…) by year, so I can visualize, in an intuitive way, how a career path has developed.\nThus our goal is to create an interactive network of the CV. If you would like to know how to generate something similar, continue to read.\nIntroduction The inspiration for this network-plot is the fantastic package and tutorial datadrivencv, by Nick Strayer, which has the goal of automatizing the CV update. To do so, you would keep each entry on the CV on a .csv file that you would later render into a a .pdf or .html file. In such file, rows correspond to each entry on your CV, for instance your education degrees or job experiences, and columns describe the positions, for instance start year or location.\nThe data The network-plot starting point is, this way, a CV entries data file. You can check out an example of a CV entries file at Nick’s Strayer tutorial spreadsheet. You can also download the necessary data to replicate this tutorial here.\nFor the network plot I just need each entry on the CV and its corresponding year, so I start by filtering our data with dplyr:\n#Load entries data file: my_df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;network_entries.csv\u0026#34;) #Filter relevant columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) I want to make sure that all entries in start and end are numeric, as they should be years:\nmy_relevant_df$start \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$start) my_relevant_df$end \u0026lt;- as.numeric(my_relevant_df$end) All non numeric entries (like empty values or years set to “current”) will be transformed into NA values. I will use this in our favour to further filter the data.\nFirst I want to kick out all the rows containing NA both in start and end, as those are time independent entries (like skills) not relevant to network-plot:\n#Flag NA values with the logic statement TRUE and combine columns start and year: my_relevant_df$filter \u0026lt;- interaction(is.na(my_relevant_df$start),is.na(my_relevant_df$end)) #Filter out all entries that are \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34; (NA values in both columns) and remove the filter columns: my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df[!my_relevant_df$filter == \u0026#34;TRUE.TRUE\u0026#34;,] my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(title, start, end) Our last step on data cleaning is assign year values to the remaining NA:\nNA values at the start column are assigned to be the same value that end year (i. e., a publication) NA values at the end column are assigned to current year (i. e., current job) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(start = ifelse(is.na(start), end, start)) current_year \u0026lt;- lubridate::year(lubridate::ymd(Sys.Date())) my_relevant_df \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(end = ifelse(is.na(end), current_year, end)) Now that the data is cleaned up, I will generate the two data frames I need for the network plot:\nNodes data, containing each entry on the CV Edges data, containing the (year) connections among the CV entries I start by generating the edges. First step is to assign a numeric id to each entry and selecting the year columns:\nedges \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, start, end) Then I generate the edges with a function borrowed from the datadrivencv package:\n#Combine the start and end years into a integer range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(id, start, end) { dplyr::tibble(year = start:end, id = id) }) #Nest all entries per year range edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(year) %\u0026gt;% tidyr::nest() %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rename(ids_for_year = data) #Generate the edges combination_indices \u0026lt;- function(n) { rep_counts \u0026lt;- (n:1) - 1 dplyr::tibble(a = rep(1:n, times = rep_counts), b = purrr::flatten_int(purrr::map(rep_counts, ~{ tail(1:n, .x) }))) } edges \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;% purrr::pmap_dfr(function(year, ids_for_year) { combination_indices(nrow(ids_for_year)) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::transmute(year = year, from = ids_for_year$id[a], to = ids_for_year$id[b]) }) Then I proceed to generate the nodes data frame assigning, like in the edges data frame, a numeric id. Next we select the entries on the CV (titles) and the sections they belong to, which I clean up with the stringr package:\nnodes \u0026lt;- my_relevant_df nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(id, title, section) # Make the sections look nices nodes \u0026lt;- nodes %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(section = stringr::str_to_title(stringr::str_replace_all(section, \u0026#34;_\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;))) The plot Now that I have generated the edges and nodes data frames, I can proceed with the first basic network. I do so with the visNetwork package and igraph nicely algorithm:\nvisNetwork::visNetwork(nodes, edges)%\u0026gt;% visNetwork::visIgraphLayout(layout = \u0026#34;layout_nicely\u0026#34;)%\u0026gt;% visNetwork::visOptions(highlightNearest …","date":1658534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658534400,"objectID":"39fad286292c7bc348d36afef898debf","permalink":"https://AFraderaSola.github.io/project/cvnetwork/","publishdate":"2022-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cvnetwork/","section":"project","summary":"Do you want to make your CV **shine**?
